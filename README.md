Ratus is a RESTful asynchronous task queue server. It translated concepts of distributed task queues into a set of resources that conform to REST principles and provides a consistent [HTTP API](https://hyperonym.github.io/ratus/) for various backends based on embedded or external [storage engines](https://github.com/hyperonym/ratus/blob/master/README.md#engines).

The key features of Ratus are:

* Self-contained binary with a fast in-memory storage.
* Support multiple embedded or external storage engines.
* Guaranteed at-least-once execution of tasks.
* Unified model for prioritized and time-based scheduling.
* Task-level timeout control with automatic recovery.
* Language agnostic RESTful API with built-in Swagger UI.
* Load balancing across a dynamic number of consumers.
* Horizontal scaling through replication and partitioning.
* Native support for Prometheus and Kubernetes.

## Quick Start

### Installation

Ratus offers a variety of installation options:

* Docker images are available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/hyperonym/ratus/tags) and [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/orgs/hyperonym/packages?repo_name=ratus).
* Kubernetes and Docker Compose examples can be found in the [deployments](https://github.com/hyperonym/ratus/tree/master/deployments) directory.
* Pre-built binaries for all major platforms are available on the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/hyperonym/ratus/releases) page.
* Build from source with `go install github.com/hyperonym/ratus/cmd/ratus@latest`.

Running Ratus from the command line is as simple as typing:

```bash
$ ratus
```

The above command will start an ephemeral Ratus instance using the default in-memory storage engine `memdb` and listen on the default HTTP port of **80**.

To use another port and enable on-disk snapshot for persistence, start Ratus with:

```bash
$ ratus --port 8000 --engine memdb --memdb-snapshot-path ratus.db
```

Depending on the [storage engine](https://github.com/hyperonym/ratus/blob/master/README.md#engines) you choose, you may also need to deploy the corresponding database or broker. Using the `mongodb` engine as an example, assuming the database is already running locally, then start Ratus with:

```bash
$ ratus --port 8000 --engine mongodb --mongodb-uri mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017
```

### Basic Usage

Concepts introduced by Ratus will be **bolded** below, see [Concepts](https://github.com/hyperonym/ratus/blob/master/README.md#concepts) (*a.k.a cheat sheet*) to learn more.

#### cURL

A producer creates a new **task** and pushes it to the `example` **topic**:
```bash
$ curl -X POST -d '{"payload": "hello world"}' "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/topics/example/tasks/1"
```
<details>
<summary>Example response</summary>

```json
{
	"created": 1,
	"updated": 0
}
```
</details>

A consumer can then make a **promise** to claim and execute the next task in the `example` topic:

```bash
$ curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/topics/example/promises?timeout=30s"
```
<details>
<summary>Example response</summary>

```json
{
	"_id": "1",
	"topic": "example",
	"state": 1,
	"nonce": "e4SN6Si1nOnE53ou",
	"produced": "2022-07-29T20:00:00.0Z",
	"scheduled": "2022-07-29T20:00:00.0Z",
	"consumed": "2022-07-29T20:00:10.0Z",
	"deadline": "2022-07-29T20:00:40.0Z",
	"payload": "hello world"
}
```
</details>

After executing the task, remember to acknowledge Ratus that the task is `completed` using a **commit**:

```bash
$ curl -X PATCH "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/topics/example/tasks/1"
```
<details>
<summary>Example response</summary>

```json
{
	"_id": "1",
	"topic": "example",
	"state": 2,
	"nonce": "",
	"produced": "2022-07-29T20:00:00.0Z",
	"scheduled": "2022-07-29T20:00:00.0Z",
	"consumed": "2022-07-29T20:00:10.0Z",
	"deadline": "2022-07-29T20:00:40.0Z",
	"payload": "hello world"
}
```
</details>

If a commit is not received before the promised deadline, the state of the task is will be set back to `pending`, which in turn allows consumers to try to execute it again.

#### Go Client

Ratus comes with a [Go client library](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hyperonym/ratus) that not only encapsulates all API calls, but also provides idiomatic poll-execute-commit workflows like [Client.Poll](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hyperonym/ratus#Client.Poll) and [Client.Subscribe](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hyperonym/ratus#Client.Subscribe). The [examples](https://github.com/hyperonym/ratus/tree/master/examples) directory contains ready-to-run examples for using the library:

* The [hello world](https://github.com/hyperonym/ratus/blob/master/examples/hello-world/main.go) example demonstrated the basic usage of the client library. 
* The [crawl frontier](https://github.com/hyperonym/ratus/blob/master/examples/crawl-frontier/main.go) example implemented a simple [URL frontier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crawl_frontier) for distributed web crawlers. It utilized advanced features like concurrent subscribers and time-based task scheduling.

## Concepts

### Data Model

* **[Task](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hyperonym/ratus#Task)** references an idempotent unit of work that should be executed asynchronously.
* **[Topic](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hyperonym/ratus#Topic)** refers to an ordered subset of tasks with the same topic name property.
* **[Promise](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hyperonym/ratus#Promise)** represents a claim on the ownership of an active task.
* **[Commit](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hyperonym/ratus#Commit)** contains a set of updates to be applied to a task.

### Workflow

* **Producer** client pushes **tasks** with their desired date-of-execution (scheduled times) to a **topic**.
* **Consumer** client makes a **promise** to execute a **task** polled from a **topic** and acknowledges with a **commit** upon completion.

### Topology

* Both **producer** and **consumer** clients can have multiple instances running simultaneously.
* **Consumer** instances can be added dynamically to increase throughput, and **tasks** will be naturally load balanced among consumers.
* **Consumer** instances can be removed (or crash) at any time without risking to lose the task being executing: a **task** that has not received a **commit** after the **promised** deadline will be picked up and executed again by other consumers.

### Task States

* **pending** (0): The task is ready to be executed or is waiting to be executed in the future.
* **active** (1): The task is being processed by a consumer. Active tasks that have timed out will be automatically reset to the `pending` state. Consumer code should handle failure and set the state to `pending` to retry later if necessary.
* **completed** (2): The task has completed its execution. If the storage engine implementation supports TTL, completed tasks will be automatically deleted after the retention period has expired.
* **archived** (3): The task is stored as an archive. Archived tasks will never be deleted due to expiration.

### Behavior

* **Task IDs across all topics share the same namespace** ([ADR](https://github.com/hyperonym/ratus/blob/master/docs/ARCHITECTURAL_DECISION_RECORDS.md#task-ids-should-be-unique-across-all-topics)). Topics are simply subsets generated based on the `topic` properties of the tasks, so topics do not need to be created explicitly.
* Ratus is a task scheduler when consumers can keep up with the task generation speed, or a priority queue when consumers cannot keep up with the task generation speed.
* Tasks will not be executed until the scheduled time arrives. After the scheduled time, excessive tasks will be executed in the order of the scheduled time.

## Engines

Ratus provides a consistent API for various backends, allowing users to choose a specific engine based on their needs without having to modify client-side code.

To use a specific engine, set the `--engine` flag or `ENGINE` environment variable to one of the following names:

| Name | Persistence | Replication | Partitioning | Expiration |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| `memdb` | ○/● | ○ | ○ | ● |
| `mongodb` | ● | ● | ● | ● |

### MemDB

[![MemDB](https://github.com/hyperonym/ratus/actions/workflows/memdb.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/hyperonym/ratus/actions/workflows/memdb.yml)

MemDB is the default storage engine for Ratus. It is implemented on top of [go-memdb](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-memdb), which is built on immutable radix trees. MemDB is suitable for development and **production environments where durability is not critical**.

#### Persistence

The MemDB storage engine is ephemeral by default, but it also provides **snapshot-based persistence** options. By setting the `--memdb-snapshot-path` flag or `MEMDB_SNAPSHOT_PATH` environment variable to a non-empty file path, Ratus will write on-disk snapshots at an interval specified by `MEMDB_SNAPSHOT_INTERVAL`.

MemDB does not write [Append-Only Files](https://redis.io/docs/manual/persistence/#aof-advantages) (AOF), which means in case of Ratus stopping working without a graceful shutdown for any reason you should be prepared to lose the latest minutes of data. If durability is critical to your workflow, switch to an external storage engine like `mongodb`.

#### Implementation Details

* **List operations are relatively expensive** as they require scanning the entire database or index until the required number of results are collected. Fortunately, these operations are not used in most scenarios.
* Snapshotting is performed along with the periodic background jobs when appropriate. **Writing snapshot files may delay the execution of background jobs** if the amount of data is large.
* Since the resolution of the scheduled time in MemDB is in millisecond level and is affected by the instance's own clock, **the order in which consumers receive tasks is not strictly guaranteed**.
* TTL cannot be disabled for `completed` tasks, in order to preserve a task forever, set it to the `archived` state.

### MongoDB

[![MongoDB](https://github.com/hyperonym/ratus/actions/workflows/mongodb.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/hyperonym/ratus/actions/workflows/mongodb.yml)

Ratus works best with **MongoDB version ~4.4**. MongoDB 5.0+ is also supported but requires additional considerations, see [Implementation Details](https://github.com/hyperonym/ratus/blob/master/README.md#implementation-details-1) to learn more.

> 💭 **TL;DR** set `MONGODB_DISABLE_ATOMIC_POLL=true` when using Ratus with MongoDB 5.0+.

#### Replication

When using the MongoDB storage engine, the Ratus instance itself is stateless. For high availability, **start multiple instances of Ratus and connect them to the same MongoDB replica set**.

All Ratus instances should run behind load balancers configured with health checks. **Producer and consumer clients should connect to the load balancer**, not directly to the instances.

#### Partitioning

Horizontal scaling could be achieved through sharding the task collection. However, with the help of the TTL mechanism, **partitioning is not necessary in most cases**. The best performance and the strongest atomicity can only be obtained without sharding.

If the amount of data exceeds the capacity of a single node or replica set, choose from the following sharding options:

* If there is a large number of topics, **use a hashed index on the `topic` field as the shard key**, this will also enable the best polling performance on a sharded cluster.
* If there is a huge amount of tasks in a few topics, **use a hashed index on the `_id` field as the shard key**, this will also result in a more balanced data distribution.

#### Implementation Details

* When using the MongoDB storage engine, **tasks across all topics are stored in the same collection**.
* Task is the only concrete data model in the MongoDB storage engine, while topics and promises are just conceptual entities for enforcing the RESTful design principles.
* Since the resolution of the scheduled time in MongoDB is in millisecond level and is affected by the instance's own clock, **the order in which consumers receive tasks is not strictly guaranteed**.
* TTL cannot be disabled for `completed` tasks, in order to preserve a task forever, set it to the `archived` state.
* It is not recommended to upsert tasks on sharded collections using the `topic` field as the shard key. Due to MongoDB's own [limitations](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v4.4/reference/method/db.collection.replaceOne/#shard-key-modification), atomic operations cannot be used in this case, and only a fallback scheme equivalent to delete before insert can be used, so atomicity and performance cannot be guaranteed. This problem can be circumvented by using simple inserts in conjunction with fine-tuned TTL settings.
* By default, polling is implemented through `findAndModify`. In the event of a conflict, MongoDB's native [optimistic concurrency control](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v4.4/faq/concurrency/#how-granular-are-locks-in-mongodb-) (OCC) will transparently retry the operation. But in MongoDB 5.0 and above, the retry will report a `WriteConflict` error in the database server's log (although the operation is still successful from the client's perspective). You can choose to ignore this error, or circumvent the problem by **setting `MONGODB_DISABLE_ATOMIC_POLL=true` when using MongoDB 5.0+**. This option will make Ratus to not use `findAndModify` for polling and instead rely on the application-level OCC layer to ensure atomicity.

#### Index Models

The following indexes will be created on startup, unless `MONGODB_DISABLE_INDEX_CREATION` is set to `true`:

| Key Patterns | Partial Filter Expression | TTL |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `{"topic": "hashed"}` | - | - |
| `{"topic": 1, "scheduled": 1}` | `{"state": 0}` | - |
| `{"deadline": 1}` | `{"state": 1}` | - |
| `{"topic": 1}` | `{"state": 1}` | - |
| `{"consumed": 1}` | `{"state": 2}` | `MONGODB_RETENTION_PERIOD` |

## Observability

### Metrics and Labels

Ratus exposes the following [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) metrics on the `/metrics` endpoint:

| Name | Type | Labels |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **ratus_request_duration_seconds** | histogram | `topic`, `method`, `endpoint`, `status_code` |
| **ratus_chore_duration_seconds** | histogram | - |
| **ratus_task_schedule_delay_seconds** | gauge | `topic`, `producer`, `consumer` |
| **ratus_task_execution_duration_seconds** | gauge | `topic`, `producer`, `consumer` |
| **ratus_task_produced_count_total** | counter | `topic`, `producer` |
| **ratus_task_consumed_count_total** | counter | `topic`, `producer`, `consumer` |
| **ratus_task_committed_count_total** | counter | `topic`, `producer`, `consumer` |

### Liveness and Readiness

Ratus supports [liveness and readiness probes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/) via HTTP GET requests:

* The `/livez` endpoint returns a status code of **200** if the instance is running.
* The `/readyz` endpoint returns a status code of **200** if the instance is ready to accept traffic.

## Caveats

* 🚨 **Topic names and task IDs must not contain plus signs ('+') due to [gin-gonic/gin#2633](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/issues/2633).**
* It is not recommended to use Ratus as the primary storage of tasks. Instead, consider storing the complete task record in a database, and **use a minimal descriptor as the payload for Ratus.**
* Ratus is a simple and efficient alternative to task queues like [Celery](https://docs.celeryq.dev/). Consider to use [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) or [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) if you need high-throughput message passing without task management.

## Frequently Asked Questions

For more details, see [Architectural Decision Records](https://github.com/hyperonym/ratus/blob/master/docs/ARCHITECTURAL_DECISION_RECORDS.md).

### Why HTTP API?

> Asynchronous task queues are typically used for long-running background tasks, so the overhead of HTTP is not significant compared to the time spent by the tasks themselves. On the other hand, the HTTP-based RESTful API can be easily accessed by all languages without using dedicated client libraries.

### How to poll from multiple topics?

> If the number of topics is limited and you don't care about the priority between them, you can choose to create multiple threads/goroutines to listen to them simultaneously. Alternatively, you can create a ***topic of topics*** to get the topic names in turn and then get the next task from the corresponding topic.
