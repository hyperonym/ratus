          A duration relative to the time the commit is accepted, indicating that
          the task will be scheduled to execute after this duration. When the

          precedence. It is recommended to use relative durations whenever
          possible to avoid clock synchronization issues. The value must be a
          valid duration string parsable by time.ParseDuration. This field is only
          used when creating a commit and will be cleared after converting to an
          absolute scheduled time.

  ratus.Promise:
    properties:

        description: |-
          Unique ID of the promise, which is the same as the target task ID.
          A promise with an empty ID is considered an "wildcard promise", and
          Ratus will assign an appropriate task based on the status of the queue.
          A task can only be owned by a single promise at a given time.

      deadline:
        description: |-
          The deadline for the completion of execution promised by the consumer.
          Consumer code needs to commit the task before this deadline, otherwise
          the task is determined to have timed out and will be reset to the
          "pending" state, allowing other consumers to retry.
        type: string
      timeout:
        description: |-
          Timeout duration for task execution promised by the consumer. When the
          absolute deadline time is specified, the deadline will take precedence.
          It is recommended to use relative durations whenever possible to avoid
          clock synchronization issues. The value must be a valid duration string
          parsable by time.ParseDuration. This field is only used when creating a
          promise and will be cleared after converting to an absolute deadline.

  ratus.Task:
    properties:
      _id:
        description: |-
          User-defined unique ID of the task.
          When using the MongoDB storage engine, tasks across all topics are
          stored in the same collection, thus their IDs share the same namespace.
          This is an intentional tradeoff to allow tasks to be efficiently moved
          from one topic to another.
        type: string
      consumed:
        description: |-
          The time the task was claimed by a consumer.
          Not to confuse this with the time of commit, which is not recorded.
        type: string
      consumer:
        description: Identifier of the consumer instance who consumed the task.
        type: string
      deadline:

          Consumer code needs to commit the task before this deadline, otherwise
          the task is determined to have timed out and will be reset to the
          "pending" state, allowing other consumers to retry.
        type: string

        description: |-
          A duration relative to the time the task is accepted, indicating that
          the task will be scheduled to execute after this duration. When the
          absolute scheduled time is specified, the scheduled time will take
          precedence. It is recommended to use relative durations whenever
          possible to avoid clock synchronization issues. The value must be a
          valid duration string parsable by time.ParseDuration. This field is only
          used when creating a task and will be cleared after converting to an
          absolute scheduled time.
        type: string
      nonce:
        description: |-
          The nonce field stores a random string for implementing an optimistic
          concurrency control (OCC) layer outside of the storage engine. Ratus
          ensures consumers can only commit to tasks that have not changed since
          the promise was made by verifying the nonce field.
        type: string
      payload:
        description: |-
          A minimal descriptor of the task to be executed.
          It is not recommended to rely on Ratus as the main storage of tasks.
          Instead, consider storing the complete task record in a database, and
          use a minimal descriptor as the payload to reference the task.
      produced:
        description: |-
          The time the task was created.
          Timestamps are generated by the instance running Ratus, remember to
          perform clock synchronization before running multiple instances.
        type: string
      producer:
        description: Identifier of the producer instance who produced the task.
        type: string
      scheduled:
        description: |-
          The time the task is scheduled to be executed. Tasks will not be
          executed until the scheduled time arrives. After the scheduled time,
          excessive tasks will be executed in the order of the scheduled time.
        type: string
      state:
        description: |-
          Current state of the task. At a given moment, the state of a task may be
          either "pending", "active", "completed" or "archived".
        type: integer
      topic:

          Topic that the task currently belongs to. Tasks under the same topic
          will be executed according to the scheduled time.
